# Crypto
A collection of my personal encryption projects that I have developed on my journey to educate myself on the plethora of encryption algorithms. Most of these programs have been developed from scratch knowing only the general abstract of each algorithm, as I find the challenge this presents is much more enticing.

## Rot-n
A standard [Caesarian Shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) cipher encoder, also known as a rot-N encoder. Works by translating individual characters inside a string into their respective [ASCII values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_code_chart) (which are then rotated).
